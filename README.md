# Rome Reproduction
This repo contains a rough reproduction of rank one model editing from the paper [Locating and Editing Factual Associations in GPT](https://rome.baulab.info/) (Follow link for paper and original implementation)
I have also added support for Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct along with a hacky version of the causal tracing nb from the original repo to locate the factual associations in the qwen model.

# Usage
(tested with Python 3.10.12)
pip install the requirements from `requirements.txt`
For a quick demo/example usage run the `rome/__init__.py` file from the `rome` directory.
